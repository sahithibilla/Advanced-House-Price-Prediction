🏡 Advanced House Price Prediction App

An end‑to‑end machine learning project that predicts house prices using advanced area‑based features. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, model serialization using pickle, and a fully interactive Streamlit web application for real‑time predictions.

📌 Project Overview
This project uses a Linear Regression model trained on key socio‑economic and housing features such as:

Avg. Area Income

Avg. Area House Age

Avg. Area Number of Rooms

Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms

Area Population

The goal is to build a simple, intuitive, and interactive interface where users can input these values and instantly get a predicted house price.

🚀 Features
Interactive Streamlit UI

Real‑time house price prediction

Clean and user‑friendly sidebar inputs

Model trained using scikit‑learn

Pickle‑based model loading

Modular and easy‑to‑extend codebase

🧠 Machine Learning Model
The model is trained using:

Linear Regression

Train‑test split

Evaluation metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE

The trained model is saved as lr.pkl and loaded directly inside the Streamlit app.
